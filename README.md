# projects-utexas

This is a monorepo of course projects I enjoyed working on during my time at UT Austin.

## Objectives

The objectives of this repo are:

- To demonstrate my own ability to work in a R, C++, Go and Rust hybrid environment and produce statistically
  meaningful results.
- For future students to reference on what the courses are about.


## Courses Included

It currently includes the following courses, I may post more in the future:

- [SDS 322E](22fall_SDS322E/_syllabus.pdf): Element of Data Science
  - [Analysis of Occurrence Frequency and Patterns of Reported Drug Events in the US](22fall_SDS322E/Analysis%20of%20Occurrence%20Frequency%20and%20Pattern%20of%20Reported%20Adverse%20Events%20in%20select%20Drug%20Classes%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf): A study of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) using R and Rcpp. [code base](22fall_SDS322E/Project_2)

## For Instructors of these Courses

I chose to publish these projects/homeworks because one of these is true:

- I have your explicit permission to reproduce this.
- I believe I hold copyright to this work and I will not infringe your copyright (to your course materials) by reproducing it.
  This boils down to the following points:
  - Solely my own work: I did not receive direct input from you or other students when working on the published portion of this project other than to fit my idea into your grading requirements.
  - Transformative: The project does not resemble any copyrighted course material
    more than headings, formats or trivial instructions.
  - Highly Unique: Any future student should not be able to use only what I have published to reproduce my solution without more knowledge and effort than the original project/homework had asked for by itself.

However, if you are the instructor and you have a legitimate concern on one of my published projects, please send me an E-mail at yume [at] yumechi.jp and I will take it down.
